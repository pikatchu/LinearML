LinearML (or LiML) is a programming language designed to write efficient parallel programs.
Its main characteristics are:

    * Purely functional
    * Statically typed
    * Strict evaluation order

In LiML, the default is, every value has a linear type, this implies:

    * Thread-safe copy-less message-passing between threads
    * Thread-safe IOs
    * In-place updates for the vast majority of operations (better cache hits)
    * Statically enforced memory management. 
      In other words, there is no garbage collector, the memory usage is safe, it's garanteed statically ! 


To compile LiML, follow the instructions in INSTALL
